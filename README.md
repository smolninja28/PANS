# PANS: PROS Anti-Nuisance Systems
PANS is a code library for PROS that aims to simplify some difficult tasks by creating easy-to-use utilities.

This system is built using the Purdue Robotics Operating System (PROS) for V5, and thus can only be used in that environment.  This library will not work with legacy, Cortex-Based control systems.

PANS is designed to be modular, so only the systems in use are compiled.  Simply include the headers for the systems you want to use!

Some modules require the use of OkapiLib, while others use PROS' LVGL library.

PANS is completely open source, so anyone can use, modify, and distribute this code.

PANS is currently under initial development, so functionality is lacking and documentation is far and wide.  This will be improved with time.
